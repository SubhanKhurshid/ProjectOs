## Introduction 
The Sleeping Barber Problem is a classic synchronization problem in Operating Systems that involves managing resources in a multi-process environment. It is a scenario where a barber shop has one barber and multiple chairs for customers to wait in line. The barber alternates between sleeping in the back room and cutting hair in the barber chair, while customers arrive and take a seat in one of the chairs if they are available. If there are no available chairs, they leave and come back later. In this project, we aim to implement the Sleeping Barber Problem using system calls in an operating system. This project will provide a practical understanding of synchronization mechanisms and system calls in operating systems, as well as the challenges involved in developing concurrent programs.

## Implementation 
We have used ubuntu 16.04.7 for the implementation of this project.
